Hello Git and Github

Here we have a practice project from Codecademy.
- The object of this project is to create a random message/joke/astrology/nonsense generator. Utilizing three (3) or more parts of 'random' content generate a new message every time the application is opened.

I have chosen to go with an Affirmation Generator. Every morning you can open the app and recieve your daily affirmation for you to keep and repeat throughout the day.
